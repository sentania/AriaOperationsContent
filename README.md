# vROPS-dashboards

This is a repo of dashbaords I have either created or found and incorporated into my usage of Aria Operations to monitor my lab or demonostrate valueable VCF Use Cases.

# What Dashboards are there?

* Hosts In A Group Dashboard

    Shows how to utilize a custom group as a source to drive a view showing a list of objects contained in the view.  Not really a useful dashboard, but a learning exercise

* VCF License Consumption Overview

    A powerful dashboard and handful of supermetrics to display the license consumption of VCF, NSX, Automation for all connected vCenter instances.  This dashboard derives all information from the captured licensing metrics from vCenter

* VM Rightsize Justification

    This dashboard is aimed at helping provide insight into clean up opportunities with a gloabal view, versus the datacenter centric view by default.  It's primary goal is to provide supporting evidence about why a given resource should be rightsized.

* vROPsTop Dashboard

    A dashboard focused on providing an ESXtop like experience, but in vROPS
